# MarsRoversCodeTest
This program calculates the end position of Mars Rovers after executing a series of movement instructions inside of an exploration grid. 
It receives the north eastern most coordinate and then the start coordinate and movement instructions for two rovers. It will then display the end position of each rover.
A Coordinate class is used to parse coordinate input and hold the rover's position. A Rover class is used to calculate the rover's movement in the exploration grid.

To solve this problem I made the following assumptions: 
- the user will know how the input should be inserted
- that there are only two rovers,
